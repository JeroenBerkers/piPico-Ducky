Based on the online tutorial of NetworkChuck on Youtube, I created my own piPico-Ducky. (https://youtu.be/e_f9p-_JWZw?si=kVizKoEjIPA4bPeQ)
I use it only for educational purposes and pranks with friends and family.

I edited both files, so I can either suppress the USB Staorage or the execution of the script. Or both.

Just put in some extra lines of code to use a header-pin-connector which connects GPIO 15 to GRD for USB or GPIO 16 to GRD for execution.
If you use two, you can suppress both.
